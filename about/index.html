      <p>This is the personal site of Levi McCallum, a California based consumer application developer focused on creating meaningful experiences. I'm currently consulting with forward thinking companies and startups on their iOS and web applications. Previously, I co-founded Glean—an educational video platform and multi-channel network—and was a part of the founding team of Creative Market. My passions lie in bringing the holistic vision of a craftsman to all aspects of my work, whether it's interface development, API design, or even performance and algorithm analysis.</p>

      <p>In my spare time I enjoy conversations about culture, backpacking, researching video game mechanics and user behavior, and learning about coffee.</p>
