  <p>I worked with <a href="http://riotgames.com" title="Riot Games">Riot Games</a> (creators of League of Legends) to create a series of applications for live events such as Anime Expo 2014, Fan Expo 2014, and Pax Prime 2014.</p>

  <p><strong>Champ Select</strong> — An iPad app that lets League of Legends players take a photo with their favorite champion from the game. The app provides an elegant browsing experience for players to find or search for the favorite champion, swipe through splash artwork, and display their choice on a 200-inch wall display as a photo backdrop. The app interfaces with an Apple TV to wireless project a selected splash artwork on the screen behind them.</p>

  <p><strong>LoL 360</strong> — A 360 video booth that records a stylized 360° video of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay" title="Cosplay on Wikipedia">cosplayers</a>. The experience consists of both a iPod Touch app and an iPad app. The iPod Touch app is used as a camera that records the video as it communicates with an Arduino-powered booth rotating the camera 360 degrees around the cosplayer. The final video is uploaded to the iPad app that lets the cosplayer preview and share the video to Twitter, Facebook and Email.</p>

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
