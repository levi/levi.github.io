  <p>Hiking aimlessly up the goat-laden coastal hills of the Italian Riviera, I found myself out of breath.</p>

  <p>“Why didn't we plan this out better?”</p>

  <p>That was inconsiderate. My girlfriend beside me had just spent the past two weeks meticulously planning for this very day and I was completely in the dark about why we just didn't get on the tour bus with all the other trigger-happy tourists. This was likely because my concept of planning vacation left me in the dark. I would ask my friends where I should go, put them in a list, and then email her my final recommendations. She, on the other hand, rivaled Rick Steves with her 12 page spreadsheets and detailed calendar itinerary.</p>

  <p>I assumed this was only a problem I would encounter 2 weeks a year on vacation. Back home, however, I discovered my ineptness extended into catchups with friends. We would decide to get together, only to spend most of the week reenacting 12 Angry Men in an iMessage group chat. Everyone wanted to meet at their favorite place at a different time and once we finally agreed upon the 5-Ws, we lost about 5 people in the process.</p>

  <p>Enter TripChat for iOS. My buddy <a href="http://umi.io" title="Jon Lewis, God Among Men">Jon Lewis</a> and I got together to solve this problem. We ended up merging a casual group chat with planning and itinerary tools. TripChat allows a group of people to recommend places to go and automatically keeps track of decision made with a nice, ordered itinerary. No longer would it be difficult to know who can come to dinner at 7PM on Friday and no longer would planning a vacation end up in a series of indeterminate itineraries.</p>

  <p>For the real-time chat engine, I leveraged the power of Firebase as the backend store. I ended up integrating it with CoreData to enable real-time syncing and offline caching. Locations were fetched from the FourSquare API and the API server was written in Node.js with Redis and MongoDB at the helm.</p>

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
