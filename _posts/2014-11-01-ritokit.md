  <p>Whilst working with <a href="http://riotgames.com" title="Riot Games">Riot Games</a> on iOS applications, I decided to work on a personal project that aggregated live scores from League of Legends eSports tournaments and presented them in a simple iOS app. This lead to the development of an API wrapper for the Riot Games developer API I dubbed <em><a href="http://github.com/stillmotion/riotkit" title="RitoKit">RitoKit</a></em>.</p>

  <p>RitoKit offers a clean, block-based Objective-C API that abstracts away the need to interface with the RESTful JSON API. It normalizes the inconsistencies of the response data into Objective-C objects and performs all requests with NSOperationQueue and GCD.</p>

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
