  <p>Whilst working with <a href="http://riotgames.com" title="Riot Games">Riot Games</a> on iOS applications, I decided to work on a personal project that aggregated live scores from League of Legends eSports tournaments and presented them in a simple iOS app. This lead to the development of an API wrapper for the Riot Games developer API I dubbed <em><a href="http://github.com/stillmotion/ritokit" title="RitoKit">RitoKit</a></em>.</p>

  <p>RitoKit offers a clean, block-based Objective-C API that abstracts away the need to interface with the RESTful JSON API. It normalizes the inconsistencies of the response data into Objective-C objects and performs all requests with NSOperationQueue and GCD.</p>
