  <p><a href="https://glean.co" title="Glean">Glean</a> is an educational video platform I co-founded in 2013. Glean organizes thousands of K-12 video lessons from around the web by lesson content, teaching style, and education standards. Each lesson is enhanced with live Q&A and personalized lesson recommendations based upon teachers a student likes.</p>

  <p>In addition, we introduced <a href="https://glean.co/insights" title="Glean Insights">Glean Insights</a>, an analytics tool for teachers to follow their student's learning progress and viewing behavior. Teachers using the platform can identify an entire class' engagement in real-time with a live progress bar. It seemlessly allows teachers to share a single link and gain deep insight into areas of interest or struggle on any given lesson.</p>

  <p>As technical co-founder and CTO, my main focus was owning the design, development, and communication of the product; and hiring/managing technical talent.</p>

  <p>Glean is built with many technologies, like React.js, Ember.js, Rails, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, ElasticSearch, and AWS.</p>

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
