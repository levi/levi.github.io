description: >
  I worked with the team at <a href="http://www.gsdm.com" title="GSD&amp;M">GSD&M</a> to develop the latest iteration of the <a href="http://jarritos.com" title="Jarritos">Jarritos</a> soft drink website. The designers presented a single-page design with many interactive elements that required a mature Javascript front-end architecture. My role consisted of working with the design team to create a Javascript framework that allowed them to interface with their API server, URL link to various locations on the single-page, manage appearance of video and image assets from Instagram and Vine; provide store location search with a custom map, and provide a simple API for custom animations and sound effects.
